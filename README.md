## Instructions

- Clone the repository
- Create a data folder (ignored by git) and place into that folder a `.csv` of the raw OPD data named "opd_YYYY-mm-dd.csv" (for example, "opd_2016-05-26.csv").
- Run the "clean_opd.R" script, based loosely on Bea Galatas' "misc/opd_cleaning_joe.do", in order to clean the .csv and produce a dataframe ready for analysis.
