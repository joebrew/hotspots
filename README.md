## Instructions

- Clone the repository
- Create a data folder (ignored by git) and place into that folder a `.csv` of the raw OPD data named "opd_YYYY-mm-dd.csv" (for example, "opd_2016-05-26.csv").
- Run the "clean_opd.R" script, based loosely on Bea Galatas' "misc/opd_cleaning_joe.do", in order to clean the .csv and produce a dataframe ready for analysis.
- Run the "create_time_at_risk.R" script, written by Joe Brew, in order to clean the `ohds_basetmr.dta` data, and convert into "long" person-time-at-risk format.

## Datasets

- opd: outpatient diagnoses
- basetmr is the dataset which provides person-time at risk
- cross-sectional = includes moqutio control prevalence

## Misc
- There needs to be a 28 days following onset to not be considered at risk
- Take out people once above 15
- does incidence in children match up with PCR prevalence


## Other ideas
- We missed so many episodes in the < 28 days period
  - Mira (already passed CCI) protocols: look at risk factors of having multiple cases within 60 days

- To do:
- Finish OPD cleaning
- Create BaseTMR dataset
- Replicate Ilha Josina files to get incidence

## Outcomes
-Incidence 
-Prevalence from cross-sectionals
-Parasitimia analysis and risk factors
-Spatial-temporal stuff (satscan)
